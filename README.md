# Wordle4All
This program, developed during a 24-hour hackathon held by the Academies of Loudoun, aims to allow blind or otherwise visually impaired individuals 
the chance to play the popular online game "Wordle." Through the use of a speech-to-text and text-to-speech library, the program is able to hear the 
user's voice and speak the results of the on-screen game. 

Additionally, the tool Selenium was used to "scrape" the details of the webpage (including the colors and buttons on the page) 
and prepare them to be read aloud to the user.

This project is currently in-progress, as developments are being made in order to hasten the time in which the user's voice detection takes. 
Also, this project is currently being ported to a browser extension for Google Chrome to allow for the mass usage and effectiveness of the application.
